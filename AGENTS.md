# Working on Eda

Eda is an Electron Git client built with TypeScript, React, Zustand, and SQLite.
Use **Node.js 24+** and **pnpm**.

Follow these guidelines unless the user asks otherwise.

## Before editing

1. Read the files you plan to change, their exports and callers, and the relevant tests. Look for existing helpers before writing new ones.
2. Be clear about what the change should achieve and how you'll check it. State assumptions that affect the result. Look for answers in the code; ask if the remaining uncertainty would change your approach.
3. Speak up if there's a simpler solution. If you don't understand a requirement or an existing design, explain what's unclear before building on it.
4. Keep changes focused. Remove code your change makes obsolete, but leave unrelated cleanup and formatting for a separate task. When a broader refactor is requested, work within that scope.

## Where code belongs

### Frontend — `src/renderer/`

| Location             | What goes here                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `features/<domain>/` | Feature UI and its hooks. Keep code here until another feature needs it. |
| `components/ui/`     | Shared controls, messages, overlays, and interaction behavior.           |
| `components/layout/` | Shared layout components.                                                |
| `app/`               | The application shell and how features fit together.                     |
| `commands/`          | Actions used across the app.                                             |
| `stores/`            | Shared state.                                                            |
| `repository/`        | Repository view models and shared repository hooks.                      |
| `styles/`            | Design tokens, themes, and animation definitions.                        |

Shared components must not import features or `app/`. Features must not import `app/`.

Reuse the existing controls and motion helpers. Spacing, loading and error states,
keyboard focus, and reduced-motion behavior should feel consistent across the app.
Export icons through `components/ui/icons.tsx`.

- Reuse components and layouts for equivalent UI. Pass differences through props.
- Components should own their loading states and provide clear fallbacks for missing or failed data.
- Skeletons must use the real layout and match element dimensions, spacing, and responsive behavior. Check loading and loaded states for layout shifts.
- Keep visual patterns consistent. Put actions near their content, keep headers uncluttered, and style buttons by priority.

Keep gallery examples up to date. The build generates `componentInventory.ts`; don't edit it by hand.

### Backend — `src/main/`

| Location                                 | What goes here                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ipc/`                                   | Request validation and calls to services. Keep business logic out of handlers.             |
| `repo/`                                  | Repository workflows and coordination.                                                     |
| `git/`                                   | Git commands, parsing, and configuration. Only this layer spawns application subprocesses. |
| `persistence/`                           | Database access and migrations. Only this layer opens SQLite connections.                  |
| `providers/`, `credentials/`, `secrets/` | Provider integrations, credentials, and secret storage.                                    |
| `network/`, `filesystem/`                | Shared network and file operations.                                                        |
| `services.ts`                            | Service setup and dependency wiring.                                                       |

Use the existing profile guards, repository-change notifications, and `SecretStore`.
Preserve locking, profile isolation, rollback, cancellation, cleanup, and limits on I/O.
The renderer talks to the backend through the typed IPC/preload API.

### Shared code and tooling

| Location                 | What goes here                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/shared/`            | Contracts, validation, errors, and domain helpers that work in either process. |
| `src/shared/locales/en/` | User-facing text, using i18next and the existing error/localization helpers.   |
| `tests/`                 | Tests grouped by the source area they cover.                                   |
| `tests/helpers/`         | Shared fixtures and test helpers.                                              |
| `tests/desktop/`         | Electron integration tests.                                                    |
| `tests/tooling/`         | Build and architecture checks.                                                 |
| `scripts/`               | Development and packaging tools.                                               |

Keep `src/shared/` independent of React, Electron, Node, and main/renderer implementations.

## Code quality

- Write the simplest code that meets the requirement. Don't add features or abstractions for hypothetical future use.
- Follow existing conventions. If patterns conflict, use current callers and tests to choose one, explain the choice, and flag the inconsistency. Raise concerns about a convention instead of quietly inventing another.
- Keep calculations separate from I/O. Pass in dependencies where needed so logic can be tested without Electron or live services.
- Share repeated behavior. Avoid duplicate helpers, wrappers that only forward calls, and extra files that make code harder to follow.
- Put blank lines between logical steps and JSX sections. Avoid dense blocks and nested ternaries. Comments should explain a surprising decision or constraint, not narrate the code.
- Use precise types and validate inputs at boundaries. Don't hide problems behind `any`, unchecked assertions, empty catches, or broad lint suppressions.
- Keep libraries that already do the job. Use lazy loading and code splitting to reduce bundles; don't write homemade replacements or raise limits to hide growth.
- Use scripts and tools when the answer is deterministic, including routing, retries, transformations, and checks. Use model judgment where interpretation is actually needed.

## Meaningful tests

- Make the requirement clear in the test name and assertions. The test should fail if that requirement breaks. Cover risks such as races, recovery, persistence, and invalid input.
- Add regression tests for real bugs and check that they catch the failure. Formatting and trivial refactors don't need new tests.
- Extend existing suites and fixtures. Avoid duplicate coverage, assertions about private call sequences or incidental markup, and tests that only prove a library works.
- Keep fixtures and clocks predictable. Mock external dependencies, not the logic being tested. Use temporary repositories for Git behavior and desktop tests for interactions that unit tests can't cover.

## Verification

Keep working until you've checked the intended result. After a significant step,
briefly say what's done, what's verified, and what's left. If you lose track, review
the current state before continuing.

Run focused tests as you work, then finish with the relevant checks:

| Change             | Checks                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Code               | `pnpm check` — formatting, types, lint, and tests. |
| Renderer or build  | Also `pnpm build`, including bundle limits.        |
| Desktop flows      | Build first, then `pnpm test:desktop <suite>`.     |
| Documentation only | Review the text and diff; no full suite needed.    |

Review the final diff for accidental edits, duplication, and unnecessary comments.
Report what you actually checked, including failures, skipped checks, and unfinished
work. Don't describe skipped tests as passing or incomplete work as complete.
